comment below crashed the app, need to figure out why: 
class App extends React.Component {
   render() {
      return (
         <div>
            <h1>Header</h1>
            {//End of the line Comment...}
            {/*Multi line comment...*/}
         </div>
      );
   }
}


need to figure out the following:

Notice that we are using key = {i} inside map() function. This will help React to update only necessary elements instead of re-rendering entire list when something change. It is huge performance boost for larger number of dynamically created elements.


example for default props doesn't work, need to figure out why:
